If you have successfully configured a pure market making bot in step 3, and wants to proceed with liquidity mining, you need to sign up [Miner App](https://miners.hummingbot.io/) and add the read-only exchange keys in order for the Miner App to check if if there are valid open orders that are eligible for rewards.

<b>Prerequiste:</b> Your Ethereum wallet address. The Hummingbot Miners app uses your Ethereum wallet address to:

* Assign you a unique user ID. The Hummingbot miners app associates your configurations (e.g. email address, API configurations), as well as activity. This allows the miners app to display your user-specific information such as rewards earned and payout history.
* Send you token payouts: mining rewards payouts will be sent to this address
