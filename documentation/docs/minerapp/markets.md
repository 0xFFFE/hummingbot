**Active Bots** is the total number of market making bots currently running/

**Liquidity** is the total eligible open order volume across all Active Bots currently. 

**Yield/Day** shows you how much you can earn per day currently. To calculate Yield/Day, divide the daily reward (**Reward/Day**) by Liquidity. 

!!! note
    The Yield/Day is solely based on liquidity rewards and does not take into account trades executed.

!!! warning "Liquidity mining yields do not include profits or losses from trading"
    The published Yield/Day metrics only include reward payments versus order volumes. They *do not* capture the individual miner's profit or loss on the underlying strategy or any transaction fees (if any) that generated the orders created.  As a result, *liquidity mining yields are not an indication of a miner's overall portfolio return*; miners should take into consideration overall economics, and not just mining return, when deciding on participating in liquidity mining campaigns.
