The Snapshot view in Hummingbot Miner contains a breakdown of how the per-minute reward for a single market is allocated.

To navigate to it, go the Markets page and click on a row in the Available Markets table to access details about that particular Market. Then, click on a row in the Snapshots table to see the reward breakdown for that snapshot.

Alternatively, you can also reach it from the Activity page. Click on a row in the Rewards Earned table to see reward detail for each Market. Then, click on a specific Market row to see the Snapshot view.
