## What is liquidity mining?
Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

You earn rewards by running a market making bot that maintains orders on exchange order books. How much reward you earn depends on:

* The amount of your orders
* The spread (distance to the mid price) of your orders
* How long you maintain your orders on the order book

For more information, please read [the whitepaper](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-mining.pdf).

## Why is it called "liquidity mining"?
Liquidity mining is similar to Bitcoin mining in that miners run open source software on their own computers and use their own scarce resources (inventory of crypto assets).

In addition, a collective pool of participants are working together for a common goal, providing liquidity for a specific token and exchange.  In return, miners are paid out rewards according to transparent, algorithmically defined rules.

## What strategies can a liquidity miner use?
Liquidity mining rewards are determined based on limit orders created ("maker" orders).  Currently, the Hummingbot client has two strategies that create maker orders:

- [Pure market making (market making on a single exchange)](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/)
- [Cross-exchange market making](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/)

Using either of these two strategies for trading will qualify you to participate in liquidity mining and earn rewards.

## What risks does a liquidity miner bear?
Like any trading strategy, market making includes risk. One of the primary risks is **inventory risk**, the risk of negative changes in inventory value as a result of market making. For instance, if prices drop significantly in a short time period and a market maker accumulates a large position in the asset due to continual fills of their market maker's buy orders, their overall inventory value may be lower.

While the open source Hummingbot client includes features that help users better manage inventory risk and other risks, users are solely responsible for bearing these risks when using the software.

!!! note
    The published liquidity mining returns illustrate the return from liquidity rewards proportional to the value of the inventory committed to maintain orders. These figures do not take into account trading-related profits and losses.  The return figures may also fluctuate based on relative changes in the value of the base tokens, quote tokens, and the tokens used for the liquidity mining payments.

## How do you measure liquidity?
We believe that **slippage** is the optimal metric to quantify liquidity, as opposed to filled order volume, a measure widely used by the market. Slippage refers to the difference between the observed mid-market price and the actual executed price for a trade of a given size.  Calculating slippage factors in order book depth and prices at different depths, which better captures the friction and efficiency of actually trading that asset.  Deep, liquid order books have low slippage, while thin, illiquid order books have high slippage.

**We believe slippage is a more robust indicator of liquidity than trading volume**. As an ex-ante metric, slippage measures information used by traders before they trade to decide whether to execute the trade and in which venue to execute it. In contrast, volume is an ex-post metric and can be easily manipulated.

## How are liquidity mining rewards calculated?
In order to make economic sense for a market maker, the market makerâ€™s compensation must correlate with increased levels of risk. There are three main parameters that we use in liquidity mining to determine market maker compensation: (1) **time**: placing orders in the order book consistently over time, (2) **spreads**, and (3) **order sizes**.

In liquidity mining, market makers accumulate more rewards by consistently placing orders over time and earn higher rewards by placing orders with tighter spreads and with larger sizes. The real-time reward information will be displayed in the real-time Hummingbot Miner dashboard.

!!! warning "Liquidity mining return is a historic metric and not a guarantee of future return."
    The liquidity mining return displayed on the Hummingbot Miner app is calculated from the most recently collected order book information data.  The actual return may vary depending on the actual orders submitted in the specific snapshot in which orders were placed.
